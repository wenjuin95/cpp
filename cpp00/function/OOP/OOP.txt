1. different with "C" and "C++"
    - C and C++ are the same. C++ support classes and object but C not
    - provide more structured and organize way to write code

2. what is OOP (object-oriented programming)
    - use object in programming
    - help programmer create complex programs by grouping together
      related data and function
   way to organizing code to make it:
   a. reusable
   b. easy to maintain
   c. easier to understand
    
    class:
        - like a blueprint for creating object
    object:
        - just a object

3. OOP using four main principle

    encapsulation: (CPP00)
        - bundling data with method (function) that can operate on
          that data within a class
        - this hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside
          that class from directly interacting with it
        - member of other classes can interact with the attribute of another
          object through its method
          (by using "GETTER" and "SETTER")
        - EXAMPLE: encapsulate data properties and method of the data ( function )
        NOTE:
            + hiding or keeping data from external class, helps you
              keep control of your program and prevent it from becoming too
              complicated 

    polymorphism: (CPP02)
        - one task is performed by different way
        - EXAMPLE: to tell the oeprator do other thing then do the original thing
            - like "+" is to add but you can tell it to do other thing

   inheritance: (CPP03)
        - when one object acquire all the properties of the parent object
        - EXAMPLE: you need all properties from class "car" -> name, brand, year
                   for you class "motor"
   
    abstraction: (CPP04)
        - only show essential details and keeping everything hidden
