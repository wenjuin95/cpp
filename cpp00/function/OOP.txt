1. different with "C" and "C++"
    - C and C++ are the same. C++ support classes and object but C not
    - provide more structured and organize way to write code

2. what is OOP (object-oriented programming)
    - use object in programming
   way to organizing code to make it:
   a. reusable
   b. easy to maintain
   c. easier to understand

3. concept of OOP
    class:
        - like a blueprint for creating object
    object:
        - just a object
    encapsulation:
        - binding code and data together into single unit
        - this protect the data from accidental modify
        - EXAMPLE: encapsulate data properties and method of the data ( function )
    inheritance: (C03)
        - when one object acquire all the properties of the parent object
        - EXAMPLE: you need all properties from class "car" -> name, brand, year
                   for you class "motor"
    polymorphism: (C02)
        - one task is performed by different way
        - EXAMPLE: to tell the oeprator do other thing then do the original thing
            - like "+" is to add but you can tell it to do other thing
